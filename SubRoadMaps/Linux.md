### ✅ What You Need to Know (to be "Done" with Linux):

- Basic Linux architecture & distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- Terminal navigation and file system structure
- Users, groups, and permissions (chmod, chown)
- Package management (apt, yum, dnf)
- Processes and resource monitoring (`ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`)
- Bash scripting basics (variables, loops, conditions)
- File manipulation (`cat`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `find`)
- System logs (`/var/log/`)
- Services and startup (systemd, `service`, `systemctl`)
- SSH usage and key generation
- Cron jobs for task scheduling

---

### 🔧 Tools You’ll Use

- Terminal / Bash shell
- VS Code or Vim/Nano (text editors)
- `htop`, `ncdu`, `lsof`, `du`, `df`
- VirtualBox / VMware / WSL / or native Linux
- Cloud shell (AWS EC2, GCP, etc.)

### 🧪 Projects / Mini Tasks

- [ ] Setup a local VM or EC2 instance
- [ ] Create users, assign groups, and set file permissions
- [ ] Write a Bash script to automate file backup or folder cleanup
- [ ] Monitor processes and kill a frozen one manually
- [ ] Use `cron` to schedule a custom script
- [ ] Install and remove software using package manager
- [ ] Use `grep`, `cut`, and `awk` to analyze a log file

---

### 🧩 Checkpoints

- [ ] Can you create, copy, move, and delete files from the terminal?
- [ ] Can you write and run a Bash script that accepts input?
- [ ] Can you schedule a script to run every hour with `cron`?
- [ ] Can you SSH into a remote server using keys?
- [ ] Can you navigate `/var/log` and view system messages?
