### 🧪 Projects / Mini Tasks

- [ ] Create a local Git repo and add/commit files
- [ ] Connect to a remote GitHub repo and push code
- [ ] Create a new branch and merge it with the main branch
- [ ] Simulate and resolve a merge conflict
- [ ] Undo a commit using `revert` or `reset`
- [ ] Clone a repo, open a Pull Request with changes
- [ ] Document your Git journey in a repo using `README.md`

---

### 🧩 Checkpoints

- [ ] Can you explain the Git commit lifecycle (add → commit → push)?
- [ ] Can you create and merge branches without Googling?
- [ ] Can you resolve a merge conflict manually?
- [ ] Can you undo a change using `reset`, `stash`, or `revert`?
- [ ] Can you contribute to an open-source project or simulate a team workflow?

---

### 🎯 Pro Tips

- Git is more about *understanding* than memorizing commands.
- Practice merge conflicts intentionally—it’ll save you pain later!
- Master Git basics first, then explore workflows like GitFlow.
- Write clear commit messages. It helps your team *and your future self*.

### 🧠 Completion = You Can...

> Use Git confidently in solo and team environments, troubleshoot issues, and follow a healthy branching strategy using remote repositories.
