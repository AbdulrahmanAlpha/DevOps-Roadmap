## 🧠 Networking for DevOps

> Understand how systems communicate, how the internet works, and how to troubleshoot issues across networks.

---

### ✅ What You Need to Know (to be "Done" with Networking):

- What is a network (LAN, WAN, Internet)?
- The OSI Model is understood by each layer.
- TCP vs UDP:  What's the difference?
- IP Addressing: IPv4, Subnetting, CIDR basics.
- DNS, DHCP, NAT, Gateway, Firewall — what do they mean?
- Ping, traceroute, dig, nslookup — core tools.
- Port numbers and common services (e.g., 22 SSH, 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS).
- How to troubleshoot networking issues.
- Basic security awareness (what's open vs. what's exposed).

---

### 🔧 Tools You’ll Use

- `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `nslookup`, `dig`
- Wireshark (optional, for packet sniffing)
- `iptables` (for basic firewall concepts)
- `curl`, `telnet`, `nc` (to test network access)

### 🧪 Projects / Mini Tasks

- [ ] Set up a simple home lab and configure:
  - Static vs. dynamic IP
  - Hostname resolution using `/etc/hosts`
  - Use `ping`, `curl`, and `traceroute` across devices
- [ ] Run `netstat` to see listening ports
- [ ] Open a port using `iptables` and test
- [ ] Write notes explaining the OSI layers in your own words
- [ ] Use `nmap` to scan your localhost and understand open ports

---

### 🧩 Checkpoints

- [ ] Can you explain what happens when you open google.com?
- [ ] Can you describe each layer of the OSI model in plain English?
- [ ] Can you run a traceroute and explain the output?
- [ ] Can you identify issues like DNS failure vs. routing issue?
- [ ] Can you scan a network and find open ports (responsibly)?

### 🎯 Pro Tips

- Networking is everywhere, from cloud to containers.
- You don’t need to be CCNA-certified, just confident in debugging.
- Focus on the tools you’ll use daily as a DevOps Engineer.
