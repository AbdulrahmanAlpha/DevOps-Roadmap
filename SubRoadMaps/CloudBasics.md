### ✅ What You Need to Know (to be "Done" with Cloud Basics):

- What is cloud computing? (IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS)
- Global infrastructure: Region, Availability Zone, Edge Location
- Core AWS Services:
  - EC2: Virtual machines
  - S3: Object storage
  - IAM: Access management
  - VPC: Virtual networking
  - RDS: Managed databases
  - Lambda: Serverless compute
- Free Tier: How to use AWS without breaking the bank
- Understand how to:
  - Launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu)
  - SSH into a remote server
  - Upload/download files via S3
  - Create users with IAM
  - Use Security Groups (Firewall)
- Set up billing alerts to track usage 💸

### 🧪 Projects / Mini Tasks

- [ ] Create an AWS account and configure your free-tier settings
- [ ] Launch an EC2 Ubuntu instance and connect via SSH
- [ ] Create an S3 bucket and upload/download a file
- [ ] Create an IAM user with programmatic access
- [ ] Set up a billing alarm to avoid surprises
- [ ] Create a static website hosted in S3
- [ ] Launch a Lambda function with a basic "Hello World"
- [ ] Use AWS CLI to list your instances and buckets

---

### 🧩 Checkpoints

- [ ] Can you explain the difference between EC2 and Lambda?
- [ ] Can you securely access and manage an EC2 instance?
- [ ] Can you create a public S3 bucket (then disable it responsibly)?
- [ ] Can you describe what IAM is and why it matters?
- [ ] Can you monitor usage and avoid overspending?

---

### 🎯 Pro Tips

- Stick to the **Free Tier** as much as possible early on.
- Use `us-east-1` unless you need another region.
- Terminate your EC2 instances when not in use to avoid charges.
- IAM is your best friend *and* your biggest security risk — learn it well.
- Label/tag your resources. This helps in automation and cleanup.

### 🧠 Completion = You Can...

> Comfortably navigate AWS, deploy compute & storage resources, use IAM for access control, and prepare for advanced cloud skills (IaC, CI/CD, monitoring, etc.)
